<p>An extra special, ultra huge congratulations for our friend, supporter, and photographer-at-large, <a href="http://www.jenwillphoto.com/">Jennifer Williams</a>, on the opening of her studio this past weekend!</p>



<p>Jen is an amazing artist with an interesting and creative eye. She&#8217;s insanely talented and passionate about what she does, and it shows in every photograph she takes. We loved working with her and her team during our wedding and the months leading up to it. She was over and above anything we ever expected! And when the wedding was over, we hadn&#8217;t lost a photographer, we gained a friend. *sniff* Awwww!!</p>



<p>She has a camera. She will travel. She will make you look beautiful.</p>



<p>You should book her now, before she REALLY blows up, and you can&#8217;t afford her.</p>

<p><em>*She&#8217;s not paying me for this or anything. We&#8217;re just incredibly happy for her, and we want to spread her good news!</em></p>

<p>Sorrysorrysorrysorrysorry!! I am the worst. The man and I have been passing a cold back and forth to each other since last week. Such is the beauty of married life, I suppose. Someone is always breathing in your face, and you&#8217;re always breathing in theirs. It isn&#8217;t as sexy as it sounds. I mean, sometimes it is. But, not in this case. In this case, it&#8217;s disgusting.</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t have much today. My brain is pretty much fried from our one-two punch of Western medicine and homeopathic hopefulness. I do have some things I just couldn&#8217;t not tell you about.</p>



<p><a href="http://www.gilt.com/invite/somethingbold">Gilt Groupe</a> has some amazing events going on right now:</p>



<p>&#8211; One of the best skincare lines around, Clarins. Sale ends 11/07, 9:00 PM PST.</p>



<p>&#8211; StriVectin! Sale ends 11/05, 9:00 AM PDT.</p>



<p>&#8211; Aaaand&#8230;the holy freaking grail of sales&#8230;SPANX! Sale ends 11/06, 9:00 AM PDT.</p>



<p>&#8211; Also, an Alexander McQueen sale. Which falls outside of our budget conscious situation, but fuck. It&#8217;s McQueen. This houndstooth cape/coat is McQueen, it&#8217;s included in the sale, and it is practically murdering me, it&#8217;s so TO DIE. McQueen is dead. Long live McQueen! Sale ends 11/06, 9:00 AM PDT.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="315" height="420" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/med.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-107" title="mcqueen" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/med.jpg 315w, /wp-content/uploads/2010/11/med-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 315px) 100vw, 315px" /></figure>



<p>Gilt is an invitation only site. As usual, I have an invite code. Just click <a href="http://www.gilt.com/invite/somethingbold">this link</a>, sign up and shop away!Â&nbsp;As a bonus, when you join Gilt, you also get access to Jetsetter, their travel sale site. Jetsetter has some great deals on luxury hotels and resorts. Helloooooo honeymoon! As a double bonus (!!!!) when you first sign up, you&#8217;re invited to their &#8220;It&#8217;s Good to be New&#8221; sale that&#8217;s full of shoes and bags and jewelry! Oh my! GIMME DAT MARC JACOBS!! GIMME DEM PAUL AND JOE SISTER BAGS!!</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not gone, and this blog is not forgotten! I&#8217;m down with the sickness, and trying to recover before Halloween parties this weekend. I do not want to miss the opportunity to get my drink and dance on with all my costumed friends.</p>



<p>Plus, I&#8217;m trying to get the hang of inspiration boards. I think I&#8217;ve almost got it. Once I pull the switch on these Frankenstein images, WATCH OUT! </p>



<p>Hopefully, I&#8217;ll be back tomorrow with the Halloween themed wedding I&#8217;m working on. Just barely in time.</p>

<p>OK. So that post about the Save the Date was sort of lame. I mean, the video is cute, but the post itself was lame. To make it up to you, I have some super sexy sale items to show you.</p>



<p>HauteLook has gorgeous ADIA KIBUR jewelry on sale right now. Statement jewelry, large stones, interesting mixes of metals and finishes. Lots of beautiful pieces for beautiful brides! Like this bracelet:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="333" height="500" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Screen-shot-2010-10-25-at-4.16.47-PM-333x500.png" alt="" class="wp-image-92" title="bracelet" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Screen-shot-2010-10-25-at-4.16.47-PM-333x500.png 333w, /wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Screen-shot-2010-10-25-at-4.16.47-PM-200x300.png 200w, /wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Screen-shot-2010-10-25-at-4.16.47-PM.png 363w" sizes="(max-width: 333px) 100vw, 333px" /></figure>



<p>HauteLook is a members only shopping site, and this particular jewelry sale goes away on 10/27, but I have an <a href="http://www.hautelook.com/invite/SBold919">invitation code</a> for you! Just sign up and get shopping!</p>



<p><a href="http://whiteaisle.com/homepage.htm">The White Aisle</a> is currently offering 50% off raised ink invitations and 10% off letterpress invitations through 11/30, 50% off all 2010 Do It Yourself invitations and free ground shipping on orders over $200. We bought our invitations from them, and they weren&#8217;t the cheapest option, but they were a lot cheaper than a lot of other invites I looked at. I loved our invitations, when I found them, I knew they would be the perfect first impression of our wedding.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="599" height="341" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Screen-shot-2010-10-25-at-4.39.30-PM.png" alt="" class="wp-image-93" title="invitations" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Screen-shot-2010-10-25-at-4.39.30-PM.png 599w, /wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Screen-shot-2010-10-25-at-4.39.30-PM-300x170.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 599px) 100vw, 599px" /></figure>



<p>The White Aisle is a small company, and they were really great to work with. They were in contact with us through every step of the process, and were able to design and word our reply cards exactly how we wanted. I can definitely recommend them. I wouldn&#8217;t recommend anyone buy letterpressed invitations, even at a discount they&#8217;re crazy expensive for a piece of paper that will get lost, shuffled in with bills, maybe stuck to the fridge, and then ultimately thrown out. We went with flat printing on gold paper, and they looked amazing. I never missed the raised letters.</p>



<p>This isn&#8217;t a sale item in a traditional sense. But, $495 is pretty good for a wedding dress. And, this UH-MAZING o<a href="http://www.betseyjohnson.com/product/index.jsp?productId=4263985">mbre Betsey Johnson strapless gown</a> would be an insanely memorable and stylish way to spend $495. I would freak out to see someone wearing this as a wedding dress.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="279" height="463" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Screen-shot-2010-10-25-at-4.46.52-PM.png" alt="" class="wp-image-94" title="ombregown" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Screen-shot-2010-10-25-at-4.46.52-PM.png 279w, /wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Screen-shot-2010-10-25-at-4.46.52-PM-180x300.png 180w" sizes="(max-width: 279px) 100vw, 279px" /></figure>



<p>Seriously. Freak. The. Fuck. Out.Â&nbsp;Could you imagine?</p>



<p>Does it make you dizzy to score something fabulous at killer price? Me too! Did you get a tingle from these deals like I did? You did!? I knew we were meant to be. Oooh, baby&#8230;I promise to keep giving you what you need. All cheap and chic like Moschino, all the time!</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s FRENCH on a pile of saved money!</p>
