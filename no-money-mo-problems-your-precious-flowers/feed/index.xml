Personally, I don&#039;t think the engagement ring is part of the actual wedding budget. All of my budget research only includes wedding bands, so I think that agrees. Generally, an engagement ring is purchased pretty far in advance, so it&#039;s a separate expense. Plus, if your parents are paying for the wedding, they aren&#039;t going to buy your engagement ring too. Wedding bands? Yes. Engagement rings? Probably not. In the end, if you&#039;re paying for everything, it&#039;s six in one hand, half a dozen in the other.]]></description>

Of course you should include that cost. You would include the cost of the wedding rings, right?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[We didn&#039;t have to buy our vases. The florist loaned them to us. Maybe girls can ask their florist if this is an option.  It saved money. The only downside is that people can take the arrangements home, but not the containers.]]></description>
